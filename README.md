# Thriva üå±
**A holistic personal growth platform powered by AI**

Built at HackPSU



## üìñ Overview
Thriva is a comprehensive platform that combines AI-powered conversations with personal growth tools to help users become their best selves. Through meaningful reflection, habit tracking, and community support, Thriva creates a space where personal development feels natural and rewarding.


## ‚ú® Inspiration

We wanted to create a space where people could grow through meaningful reflection. Traditional apps felt disconnected and cold. We envisioned a companion that listens, learns, and helps users become their best selves.


## üéØ What it does

Thriva combines AI-powered conversations with personal growth tools:

- **AI Conversations**: Chat with AI for personalized advice and emotional support
- **Smart Journaling**: Document thoughts, track emotions, and reflect on experiences
- **Calendar Integration**: Organize goals, habits, and track daily progress
- **Social Features**: Connect with friends for mutual support and accountability
- **Achievement System**: Earn badges for milestones and consistent progress
- **Personal Growth Analytics**: Track your journey and celebrate improvements


## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

We built Thriva using modern web technologies:

- The AI conversations use large language models for natural interactions
- Designed an intuitive interface focused on user experience
- Backend handles user data securely with proper authentication
- Integrated calendar APIs and social features for seamless connectivity
- Real-time data synchronization across all features
- Responsive design for access across devices

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.Js/TypeScript/Node.Js
- **AI/ML**: Claud LLM for conversational AI
- **Database**: Supabase
- **APIs**: Calendar integration, real-time sync
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication system


## üí™ Challenges we ran into

Understanding all the different tools was overwhelming at first. Each technology had its own learning curve. Figuring out how to connect the AI, database, and frontend was tricky. We had to learn how different APIs work together. Making all the features communicate seamlessly took time. Debugging integration issues between components was frustrating. Finding the right architecture to weave everything together required experimentation.

## üìö What we learned

- AI integration is powerful but requires careful prompt engineering
- User experience matters more than features
- Privacy builds trust in personal wellness applications
- Small wins through badges drive long-term engagement
- Personal growth apps need both structure and flexibility
- Building for emotional wellbeing requires empathy in design
